```{tab-item} Things I learned  
* Understanding how to build and apply labels in JupyterBook.
* I got more comprehension on using Jupter Lab and my Terminal.
* Understanding the way to structure the book into different chapters was the most interesting. 
```

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult 
* I was unfortunate enough where I got the Jupyter Lab package bug when trying to work with the project. When I tried to reinstall the patched packages, this messed up my kernel settings for the existying digital-portfolio. With hours of research and with the lack of experience, I ended up creating a new JupyterBook which defaulted to the new kernel. 
* I found the JupyterBook guidelines to not be user friendly. The codes are explained in a way that are not intuitive, causing a lot of unnecessary struggle.
