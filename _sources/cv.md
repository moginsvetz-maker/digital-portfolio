<u>Summary:</u>  
As a data scientist with a PhD degree and 5 years of work experience (see my [experience](Experience)), I have a deep understanding of statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization. My career has been focused on solving complex business problems through the use of data-driven insights, and I have a proven track record of delivering measurable results (see [experience](Experience) section).
